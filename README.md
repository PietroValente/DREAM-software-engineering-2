## RASD

The _Requirement Analysis and Specification Document_ (RASD) aims at illustrating a complete overview of the project, providing a baseline for its planning and development. It guides the reader in understanding the specifics of the application domain and the relative System in terms of **functional requirements**, **non functional requirements** and **constraints**. It details how, according to these, the System interacts with the external world, showing concrete **use case scenarios**. A more comprehensive description of the most relevant features will be modelled with the use of the Alloy language.

## DD

The _Design Document_ (DD) is aimed to provide an overview of the application, explaining how to satisfy the project requirements declared in the RASD and stating the successive refinements made together with the Stakeholders according to their needs. The document is mainly intended to be used by developers teams as a guidance in the development process, by testing teams to write automated testing and to avoid structural degradation of the System in case of maintenance or future extension. Indeed, its purpose is to provide a functional description of the main **architectural components**, their **interfaces** and their **interactions**, along with the **design patterns**.

## ITD

The _Implementation and Test deliverable_ (ITD) will include the **code** and **description** of prototype we have developed, a document section describing the **structure of the code**, the adopted development **frameworks**, the **installation instructions** and **test** information.
