## Overview

Data-dRiven PrEdictive FArMing in Telengana (DREAM) is a project that aims to improve agricultural production in Telegana, in a system that integrates the work of farmer, policy maker and agronomist.

For each of these figures, different objectives have been devised:

* **Policy makers:** the system must guarantee them the ability to monitor the evolution of the entire national production process, distinguishing the farmers who have been more successful from those who needs help and allowing them to analyze whether the advice given by agronomists leads to significant results. Policy makers have the opportunity to see the ranking of the year with the efficiency scores of the farms in real time, they reward the best ones only once a year, after which the ranking is reset.
* **Agronomists:** the system must assure them to write reports on the farms they visit containing the advice they have given with the help provided by DREAM AI; namely an AI algorithm of the system which proposes possible general suggestions on the production of each farm that the agronomist can choose to use or not. Only agronomists are allowed to give advice because they have the skills to do so, DREAM AI is just a tool used to help agronomists improving their advices which works by analysing the evolution of the farmâ€™s production overtime and comparing it to the data related to other farms. The agronomists selected by the government are trained to give, in particular, effective advice against climate change. Each agronomist is associated with an area, which corresponds to a province of Telengana.
* **Farmers:** the system must allow them to view relevant information such as weather predictions but also to take advantage of the personalized suggestions provided by agronomists after each visit to the farm. Furthermore, it will be possible for each farmer to interface with others by asking them for help or by creating a new discussion on the related forum. The advice given in this area remains informal and its effectiveness is not monitored.

## RASD

The _Requirement Analysis and Specification Document_ (RASD) aims at illustrating a complete overview of the project, providing a baseline for its planning and development. It guides the reader in understanding the specifics of the application domain and the relative System in terms of **functional requirements**, **non functional requirements** and **constraints**. It details how, according to these, the System interacts with the external world, showing concrete **use case scenarios**. A more comprehensive description of the most relevant features will be modelled with the use of the Alloy language.

## DD

The _Design Document_ (DD) is aimed to provide an overview of the application, explaining how to satisfy the project requirements declared in the RASD and stating the successive refinements made together with the Stakeholders according to their needs. The document is mainly intended to be used by developers teams as a guidance in the development process, by testing teams to write automated testing and to avoid structural degradation of the System in case of maintenance or future extension. Indeed, its purpose is to provide a functional description of the main **architectural components**, their **interfaces** and their **interactions**, along with the **design patterns**.

## ITD

The _Implementation and Test deliverable_ (ITD) will include the **code** and **description** of prototype we have developed, a document section describing the **structure of the code**, the adopted development **frameworks**, the **installation instructions** and **test** information.
